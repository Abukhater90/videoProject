In this code:

You have an empty array called tasks and an object called addTask.

You define a function called addTaskToArray that takes a parameter taskToAdd, which represents the task you want to add to the tasks array.

You call the addTaskToArray function and pass the addTask object as a parameter. This will add the addTask object to the tasks array.

Finally, you log the tasks array to the console to check that the addTask object has been added to the array.

Now, when you run this code, the addTask object will be added to the tasks array, and you can access it as tasks[0] because it's the first element in the array.
